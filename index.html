                        <h4>The Conflict (1754-1763)</h4>
                        <p>George Washington was only 21 years old when he first gained military experience during the French and Indian War. He served as a British colonial officer, fighting alongside the British Army against French forces and their Native American allies for control of the Ohio River Valley.</p>

                        <h4>Washington's Role</h4>
                        <p>Washington led Virginia militia forces and participated in several key battles, including the disastrous Battle of Fort Necessity in 1754. Despite early defeats, he gained invaluable combat experience and earned respect as a military leader. He learned British military tactics, understood their strengths and weaknesses, and built relationships with fellow colonial officers.</p>

                        <h4>How This Led to Revolution</h4>
                        <p><strong>Military Experience:</strong> Washington's wartime experience gave the colonists a trained, capable military leader when revolution came. Without this experience, the Continental Army would have lacked skilled leadership.</p>

                        <p><strong>British Disrespect:</strong> During the war, Washington witnessed British officers treating colonial soldiers as inferior. British regulars received higher pay and better treatment than colonial fighters, creating resentment. This discrimination angered Washington and other colonial officers.</p>

                        <p><strong>War Debt & Taxation:</strong> The French and Indian War left Britain with massive debt. To pay for it, Britain began taxing the American colonies heavily, leading directly to colonial anger and protests that sparked revolution.</p>

                        <p><strong>United Colonial Identity:</strong> Fighting together in the war helped colonists from different regions develop bonds and a shared American identity, making unified resistance to Britain possible.</p>

                    <h2>The Proclamation Line of 1763</h2>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <h4>What Was It?</h4>
                        <p>After winning the French and Indian War, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763. This royal decree drew an imaginary boundary line along the Appalachian Mountains, forbidding American colonists from settling on lands west of the line. The land was reserved for Native American tribes.</p>

                        <h4>Britain's Reasons</h4>
                        <p>Britain claimed the Proclamation would prevent conflicts between colonists and Native Americans, making the frontier cheaper to defend. The British government also wanted to control westward expansion and the profitable fur trade. They needed to maintain peaceful relations with Native American tribes after the expensive war.</p>

                        <h4>Colonial Outrage</h4>
                        <p>Colonists were furious! Many had just fought in the French and Indian War specifically to gain access to western lands. Veterans had been promised land grants as payment for military service. Land speculators, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, had invested heavily in western land companies and stood to lose fortunes.</p>

                        <h4>How This Led to Revolution</h4>
                        <p><strong>Economic Freedom Denied:</strong> The Proclamation showed Britain would restrict colonial economic opportunities and growth, angering merchants, farmers, and land speculators.</p>

                        <p><strong>Colonial Rights Ignored:</strong> Colonists felt they had earned the right to western lands through their blood and sacrifice in the war. Britain's decree proved the king didn't respect colonial interests or sacrifices.</p>

                        <p><strong>Pattern of Control:</strong> This was the first of many British restrictions on colonial freedom. It established a pattern where Britain imposed rules without colonial input, violating the principle that British subjects should only be governed by laws they helped create.</p>

                        <p><strong>Defiance Culture:</strong> Many colonists simply ignored the Proclamation and settled west anyway, developing a culture of resistance to British authority that would grow stronger with each new British restriction.</p>

                    <h2>The Tea Act of 1773</h2>
                    <div class="card-content">
                        <h4>What Was the Tea Act?</h4>
                        <p>In 1773, the British Parliament passed the Tea Act to help the struggling British East India Company. The law allowed the company to sell tea directly to the colonies without paying certain taxes, making their tea cheaper than smuggled Dutch tea. However, the tea still included a small tax that colonists had to pay.</p>

                        <h4>Why Did Britain Pass It?</h4>
                        <p>The British East India Company was near bankruptcy and had warehouses full of unsold tea. The company was politically powerful and economically important to Britain. The Tea Act was designed to save the company while also establishing Britain's right to tax the colonies. British leaders thought colonists would accept the tax because the tea would be cheaper than ever before.</p>

                        <h4>Colonial Reaction</h4>
                        <p>Colonists were outraged for multiple reasons. First, the act gave the East India Company a monopoly, destroying colonial tea merchants' businesses. Second, accepting the cheaper tea meant accepting Parliament's right to tax colonists without their consent - a principle colonists fiercely opposed. The slogan "No taxation without representation" became a rallying cry.</p>

                        <h4>The Boston Tea Party</h4>
                        <p>On December 16, 1773, colonists in Boston took dramatic action. Disguised as Mohawk Indians, members of the Sons of Liberty boarded three British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor. This bold act of defiance destroyed tea worth about $1.7 million in today's money.</p>

                        <h4>How This Led to Revolution</h4>
                        <p><strong>Taxation Principle:</strong> The Tea Act crystalized the core conflict: Could Britain tax colonists who had no representation in Parliament? Colonists said no, establishing the revolutionary principle of self-governance.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Intolerable Acts:</strong> Britain's furious response to the Boston Tea Party included closing Boston's port, restricting Massachusetts government, and quartering troops in colonial homes. These "Intolerable Acts" pushed moderate colonists toward revolution.</p>

                        <p><strong>Colonial Unity:</strong> Other colonies rallied to support Boston, sending food and supplies. The First Continental Congress formed in 1774 to coordinate colonial resistance, creating the governmental structure that would lead the Revolution.</p>

                        <p><strong>Point of No Return:</strong> The Tea Act and the resulting Boston Tea Party made compromise increasingly difficult. Both sides hardened their positions, making armed conflict nearly inevitable.</p>

                    <div class="card-content">
                        <h4>Franklin's Early Loyalty to Britain</h4>
                        <p>Benjamin Franklin was one of the most famous Americans in the world - a scientist, inventor, writer, and diplomat. For most of his life, Franklin proudly considered himself a loyal British subject. He even served as a colonial agent in London, representing Pennsylvania and other colonies to the British government.</p>

                        <h4>The Hutchinson Letters Affair (1772-1774)</h4>
                        <p>Franklin obtained private letters written by Thomas Hutchinson, the royal governor of Massachusetts, which revealed his attempts to restrict colonial freedoms. When Franklin leaked these letters to Patriots in Boston, it caused a scandal. British officials publicly humiliated Franklin before the Privy Council in 1774, mocking and insulting him for over an hour. This personal attack turned Franklin from a loyal diplomat into a committed revolutionary.</p>

                        <h4>Franklin's Revolutionary Contributions</h4>
                        <p><strong>Political Leadership:</strong> Franklin served in the Second Continental Congress and helped draft the Declaration of Independence. His reputation and wisdom gave credibility to the revolutionary cause.</p>

                        <p><strong>International Diplomacy:</strong> Franklin's most crucial contribution was securing French support. As ambassador to France (1776-1785), he negotiated the critical French alliance that provided money, weapons, troops, and naval support essential to American victory.</p>

                        <p><strong>Propaganda & Ideas:</strong> Franklin's writings, political cartoons (like "Join, or Die"), and persuasive arguments helped convince Americans and Europeans that independence was justified and achievable.</p>

                        <h4>How Franklin Helped Cause the Revolution</h4>
                        <p><strong>Intellectual Foundation:</strong> Franklin's writings on colonial rights and self-governance provided philosophical justification for independence. His ideas about liberty and representation shaped revolutionary thinking.</p>

                        <p><strong>Exposing British Intentions:</strong> The Hutchinson letters Franklin leaked proved that British officials actively plotted to reduce colonial freedoms, providing concrete evidence that reconciliation might be impossible.</p>

                        <p><strong>International Support:</strong> Franklin's fame in Europe made the American cause credible internationally. His diplomatic skills secured French aid without which independence would have been nearly impossible to achieve.</p>

                        <p><strong>Symbol of Transformation:</strong> Franklin's journey from loyal British subject to revolutionary leader showed other moderates that breaking with Britain was justified. If someone as reasonable and loyal as Franklin could become a rebel, perhaps revolution was necessary.</p>

                        <h4>The Night Before (April 18, 1775)</h4>
                        <p>British General Thomas Gage ordered 700 soldiers to march from Boston to Concord, Massachusetts, with secret orders to seize colonial weapons and arrest Patriot leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock. However, Patriot spies discovered the plan. Paul Revere, William Dawes, and Samuel Prescott rode through the night warning colonists that "the Regulars are coming out!"</p>

                        <h4>Lexington - The First Shot (April 19, 1775, dawn)</h4>
                        <p>At sunrise, British troops arrived at Lexington Green to find about 70 colonial militia men, called Minutemen, blocking their path. British Major John Pitcairn ordered the colonists to disperse. The Patriots began to leave, but suddenly a shot rang out - nobody knows who fired it. British soldiers then fired a volley, killing eight colonists and wounding ten. This was the first bloodshed of the American Revolution.</p>

                        <h4>Concord - The Tide Turns (April 19, 1775, morning)</h4>
                        <p>The British marched on to Concord and began searching for hidden weapons. Meanwhile, hundreds of Minutemen gathered at Concord's North Bridge. When British soldiers tried to cross the bridge, militia commander Colonel James Barrett gave the order to fire. The colonists forced the British troops to retreat - the first time colonial forces had defeated British regulars in combat.</p>

                        <h4>The Bloody Retreat</h4>
                        <p>As British forces retreated to Boston, thousands of colonists fired from behind trees, stone walls, and buildings along the 16-mile route. Using guerrilla tactics rather than traditional European battle formations, the Minutemen inflicted heavy casualties. By the time the British reached safety, they had suffered 273 casualties compared to only 95 American casualties.</p>

                        <h4>How This Led to Full Revolution</h4>
                        <p><strong>Point of No Return:</strong> Lexington and Concord transformed political resistance into armed rebellion. Once blood had been spilled on both sides, peaceful reconciliation became nearly impossible. The conflict had escalated beyond protests and boycotts.</p>

                        <p><strong>Proving Colonial Military Capability:</strong> The battles demonstrated that colonial militia could stand against British professional soldiers. The British army's humiliating retreat proved that Americans could fight effectively, encouraging other colonies to prepare for war.</p>

                        <p><strong>Rallying the Colonies:</strong> News of the battles spread rapidly through all thirteen colonies. "The shot heard 'round the world" convinced previously neutral or loyalist colonists that Britain was willing to kill Americans to enforce its authority. Thousands of volunteers joined the colonial militia.</p>

                        <p><strong>Creating Urgency:</strong> The battles forced the Second Continental Congress to immediately create the Continental Army and appoint George Washington as commander. The political movement for independence now had a military force to back it up.</p>

                        <p><strong>No Turning Back:</strong> After Lexington and Concord, both sides viewed the conflict as war. Britain sent more troops to crush the rebellion, while colonists began seeing independence, not just reform, as the only acceptable outcome.</p>
